# Avdhoota, yugan yugan hum yogi

#### 13 Dec, 2017

As a general rule, I find mysticism very tiring. I do not have the patience for Yoga and all that
surrounds it and I avoid god-men like toothache. I do, however, make many exceptions, and this poem
by Kabir, is one of them.

I first heard it sung by Kumar Gandharva and that is probably the reason why it has stayed with
me. That, and the fact that, on some days, solipsism makes a lot of sense.

```
अवधूता, युगन युगन हम योगी
आवैना जाय, मिटैना कबहूं, सबद अनाहत भोगी 

सब ही ठौर जमात हमरी, सब ही ठौर पर मेला
हम सब माय, सब हैं हम माय, हम है बहुरी अकेला 

हम ही सिद्ध, समाधि हम ही, हम मौनी हम बोले
रूप सरूप अरूप दिखाके, हम ही में हम तो खेलें 

कहे कबीरा जो, सुनो भाई साधो, नाही-न-कोई इच्छा
अपनी मढ़ी में आप मैं डोलूं, खेलू सहज स्वइच्छा ।

~ कबीर
```

Here's a rough translation for those who don't read Devanagari.

```
O mystic, I have been here forever,
I did not come and I'm not going,
I feed on the eternal word, I will sustain forever.

Where ever I am, I am with my people,
Where ever I am, there is a multitude,
I am with all and all are with me,
I am very alone.

I am the proof and I am consciousness,
I have no words and I speak,
All I see, I have shown myself.

Listen, as Kabir says, I wish nothing.
In my hut, I entertain myself,
with simple games,
that I want me to play.
```

My translation, obviously, does not capture the essence of the poem. 
To do that, you need to listen to Kumar*ji* sing it.
